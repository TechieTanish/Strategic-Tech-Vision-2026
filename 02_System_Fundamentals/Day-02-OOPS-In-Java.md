## About Today
Today I spent my time understanding **Java basics and OOPS concepts properly**.  
I did not rush. I tried to understand *why* things work, not only *how*.

This day helped me build a strong base in Java.

## Topics I Learned Today

### 1. Java OOPS Concepts (Basic Understanding)
I understood Java OOPS concepts clearly:
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

These concepts help in writing clean, reusable, and structured code.

---

### 2. Features of Java
Some important features of Java:
- Platform Independent
- Object Oriented
- Secure
- Robust
- Portable
- Multithreaded

---

### 3. Types of Classes in Java
I learned about different types of classes:
- Normal Class
- Abstract Class
- Final Class
- Inner Class

---

### 4. Access Specifiers
Access specifiers control visibility of variables and methods:
- public
- private
- protected
- default

---

### 5. Compiler and Interpreter
I understood the difference:
- Java source code is first **compiled** by `javac`
- Bytecode is then **interpreted** by JVM
- This makes Java platform independent

---

### 6. Structure of a Simple Java Program
I understood the basic structure of Java code:
- class keyword
- main method
- System.out.println()

Example:
```java

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Java");
    }
}
