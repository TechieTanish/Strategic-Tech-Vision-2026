# 📘 Day-07-ProgramingQuestions

Today I practiced a few core **Java programming questions** to strengthen my fundamentals and improve logical thinking.  
These problems may look simple, but they build the base for writing clean, confident, and structured code.

This practice session focused on understanding the *why* behind the logic, not just writing code.

## 🔁 Palindrome Number

### What is a Palindrome?
A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when reversed.

**Examples:**  
`121`, `1331`, `454`

### Why is it important?
Practicing palindrome logic helps in:
- Understanding number reversal
- Using loops and conditions effectively
- Improving step-by-step logical thinking

It teaches patience and clarity while breaking down a problem.

## 🔢 Armstrong Number

### What is an Armstrong Number?
An Armstrong number is a number where the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself.

**Example:**  
`153 → 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153`

### Why practice this?
This problem helps in:
- Extracting digits from a number
- Using mathematical operations correctly
- Strengthening loop-based logic

It is a great exercise for handling digits and calculations.

## ✅ Prime Number Check

### What is a Prime Number?
A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has only two factors: 1 and itself.

**Examples:**  
`2, 3, 5, 7, 11`

### Why is this important?
Prime number logic improves:
- Logical optimization
- Understanding divisibility
- Writing efficient loops

This concept is used widely in problem-solving and competitive programming.

## 🧮 HCF (Highest Common Factor)

### What is HCF?
HCF is the greatest number that divides two numbers completely without leaving a remainder.

**Example:**  
HCF of `12` and `18` is `6`

### Why learn HCF?
This helps in understanding:
- Common factors
- Mathematical relationships
- Clean and structured loop logic

It is useful in both academics and real-world problem scenarios.

## 🙏 Gratitude & Personal Note

The last few days were tough as I was not well due to illness.  
I am still recovering, but today I felt better and decided to get back to practice slowly.

Grateful for the strength to continue learning and the discipline to return, even when things feel difficult.

Consistency matters more than speed.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

More Java practice.  
Better logic.  
Stronger fundamentals.

One day at a time.
