# ☕ Java Fundamentals (Core Concepts)

This repository is focused on **Java fundamentals** — not advanced frameworks, not shortcuts, but the *building blocks* that help you truly understand how Java works.

This README documents the core concepts I’ve started with during my **placement preparation journey (2026)**.

## 📌 Why Java Fundamentals Matter

Before writing complex programs or cracking interviews, it’s important to understand **how Java reads, interprets, and processes code**.

Strong fundamentals help you:

* Write clean and predictable code
* Debug faster
* Answer conceptual interview questions confidently
* Understand OOP deeply instead of memorizing definitions

## 🧱 Java Tokens

In Java, **tokens** are the *smallest units* of a program. The compiler breaks your code into tokens to understand what you’ve written.

### 🔹 Types of Java Tokens

1. **Keywords**
   Reserved words with predefined meanings.
   Examples: `class`, `public`, `static`, `void`, `int`

2. **Identifiers**
   Names given to variables, methods, classes, etc.
   Example: `main`, `sum`, `Student`

3. **Literals**
   Fixed values used in programs.
   Examples: `10`, `3.14`, `'A'`, `true`, `"Java"`

4. **Operators**
   Symbols that perform operations.
   Examples: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `==`

5. **Separators**
   Symbols used to structure code.
   Examples: `{ } ( ) ; ,`

➡️ **Why tokens matter:** They explain *how Java reads your code*, not just how you write it.

## 🔤 ASCII Codes in Java

Computers don’t understand characters directly — they understand **numbers**.

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) assigns numeric values to characters.

### 🔹 Examples

* `'A'` → 65
* `'a'` → 97
* `'0'` → 48

In Java:

* `char` is internally stored as a number
* You can convert between characters and integers

➡️ **Why ASCII matters in Java:**

* Character comparison
* Encoding understanding
* Logic building in strings and conditions

## 🤔 Why Java Is Not Fully Object-Oriented

Java is *object-oriented*, but **not 100% pure OOP**.

### 🔹 Reasons

1. **Primitive Data Types**
   Types like `int`, `char`, `boolean` are not objects.

2. **Static Methods**
   Methods like `main()` can be called without creating an object.

3. **Wrapper Classes Exist for Primitives**
   Java uses wrapper classes (`Integer`, `Character`) to bridge performance and OOP.

➡️ Java chooses **performance + practicality** over strict purity.

This design makes Java efficient and industry-friendly.

## 🧠 Final Note

> Strong careers are built on strong fundamentals, not shortcuts.

This repo represents **discipline, consistency, and long-term thinking**.
