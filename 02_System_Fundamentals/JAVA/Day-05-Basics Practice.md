Welcome to **Java Day 05** of my learning journey.

Today’s focus was not on fancy frameworks or advanced concepts, but on **strengthening Java fundamentals** by practicing **basic questions**, writing clean logic, and **judging results correctly**.

Think of this day like brewing a strong cup of coffee ☕ — no latte art, no extra toppings, just pure beans, water, and patience. Strong basics create strong developers.

## 🎯 Objective of Day 05

* Practice **basic Java programming questions**
* Improve **logical thinking** using conditions and operators
* Analyze outputs and **judge results accurately**
* Build confidence in writing error-free beginner-level programs

---

## 🧠 Topics Practiced

The questions covered core Java fundamentals such as:

* Input handling using `Scanner`
* Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
* Ternary operator (`? :`)
* Arithmetic calculations
* Comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `==`)
* Output formatting using `System.out.println()`

These concepts act as the **roots of the Java tree** 🌱 — invisible at first, but everything depends on them.

---

## 🧪 Practice Style

Each question followed a simple but effective flow:

1. Understand the problem statement
2. Think about the logic before coding
3. Write the Java program
4. Run the code with different inputs
5. Judge the output and verify correctness

This method helped me catch mistakes early and understand *why* a result appeared — not just *what* appeared.

## ☕ Coffee Analogy (Learning Insight)

Learning Java basics is like making coffee manually:

* **Beans** → Java fundamentals (variables, conditions, operators)
* **Grinding** → Writing logic and thinking step-by-step
* **Brewing** → Running the program
* **Taste test** → Judging the output

If the basics are weak, the coffee tastes off — no matter how expensive the machine is.

```


## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Basics decide long-term coding confidence
* Small programs teach big lessons
* Reading compiler warnings improves code quality
* Practicing logic daily sharpens problem-solving skills

---

## 🚀 What’s Next

* More conditional logic problems
* Loop-based questions
* Combining multiple concepts in one program

This day reinforced one truth:

> **Strong basics today prevent confusion tomorrow.**
